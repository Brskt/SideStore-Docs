# SideStore URL Schemes

The following is the exhaustive list of different URL Schemes that can be used to interact with SideStore. These links are incredibly useful because they allow developers to simply put a one-click link on their social media or website and iOS will open the link directly in SideStore and then perform the action(s) specified.

The current list of things you can do using URL Schemes is rather limited, but it will be expanded upon in the future to take multiple inputs and perform a variety of other tasks.

### Install a remotely hosted app

```
sidestore://install?url=[download url]
```

### Add an AltSource

```
sidestore://source?url=[source url]
```
