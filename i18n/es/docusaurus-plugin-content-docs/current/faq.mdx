# Preguntas frecuentes

Esto es un listado de preguntas frecuentes sobre SideStore. Contiene preguntas comunes que recibimos desarrollando SideStore, y algunas que pudieran ser contestadas para personas en otras situaciones o teniendo problemas. 

## ¬øQu√© es SideStore?

SideStore es una aplicaci√≥n de iOS que le permite instalar apps v√≠a el "sideloading" a su dispositivo iOS utilizando solo su Apple ID. SideStore refirma las aplicaciones con su certificado personal de desarrollo y luego utiliza un VPN designado espec√≠ficamente para enga√±ar a iOS para poder instalarlo. Peri√≥dicamente, SideStore "refrescara" sus aplicaciones en el fondo para prevenir que se expiren en el periodo normal de desarrollo de 7 d√≠as.  La meta de sidestore es proveer una experiencia sin ataduras a su computadora. Es un fork de AltStore guiado por la comunidad y ya ha implementado algunas de las funcionalidades m√°s deseadas por la comunidad. Solo necesita una computadora una vez durante la instalaci√≥n.

### ¬øPuedo activar JIT? (Compilaci√≥n Just-In-Time) 

Para los usuarios de iOS/iPadOS 16 o menor, puedes activar JIT directamente desde la p√°gina de 'My Apps' manteniendo oprimido su app y seleccionando 'Enable JIT'. 

Los usuarios de iOS/iPAdOS 17.4 o mayor deber√°n utilizar una soluci√≥n como StikJIT/StikDebug o SideStore nightly. Por favor refi√©rase al tutorial en la [Secci√≥n Avanzada](advanced/jit). 

### ¬øCu√°ndo saldr√° SideStore?

Actualmente SideStore no tiene fecha de lanzamiento, pero s√≠ est√° en estado de beta p√∫blico.

### Al momento, ¬øpuedes instalar apps v√≠a el "sideloading"?

¬°S√≠ puedes, justo como AltStore!

### ¬øTienen las funcionalidades beta de AltStore?

S√≠ tenemos funcionalidades betas de AltStore, pero no siempre son las m√°s nuevas. Intentamos mantenernos al tanto o implementarlo de nuestro propio modo de ser necesario.

### ¬øEl VPN me drena la bater√≠a?

No, ya que solo se conecta al dispositivo mismo. No se utilizan servidores remotos, lo que significa que no hay conexiones externas, lo que significa que no drena la bater√≠a.

### Will the VPN track me?

It does not, as there is no remote server used.

### I cannot connect to the internet when the VPN is on

Make sure you don't have an alternate DNS set up in your Wi-Fi and WireGuard configuration. If you know the DNS IP address works, then try removing it from your Wi-Fi configuration and adding it into the WireGuard config under DNS.

### Updating SideStore hangs towards the end

Go to the homescreen for it to finish. We don't know why this happens, but it might have to do with using a VPN to direct `installd` to refresh SideStore (itself).

### Can I sign more than 3 apps to be active?

Normally, no, as that‚Äôs an iOS and developer account limitation. Apple only allows 3 apps to be installed using a free Apple Developer account.

To remove this restriction (and also get a 365 day expiry), you can pay for a $99/year Apple Developer account.

Alternatively, there is currently a nightly build available [here](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/releases/tag/nightly) (version 0.5.9-nightly.2024.10.23.1+1e969a0 as of writing) that utilizes the SparseRestore exploit to bypass the 3-app limit. Currently, this only works on iOS versions below 18 dev beta 5 plus 18.0.1 for definite.

A tutorial for using this can be found [here](advanced/sparserestore).

### I have a problem or bug or request for a feature or quality of life improvement

Please make a GitHub issue on our GitHub page to make a bug report or feature request (with appropriate labels)!

### I am a developer, how does this affect me?

It doesn‚Äôt affect you directly, other than maybe an update to AltKit when/if we get our additions.

### Do I need to update my app to support this?

Nope, as currently it acts like AltStore while signing.

### As a user, I‚Äôm having trouble logging into SideStore. I get an error

There are many reasons this can happen, but the most common issue is a temporary Anisette server downtime. You can currently change the Anisette server on your device‚Äôs Settings app in SideStore under ‚ÄúAnisette URL‚Äù.

### Is SideStore going to have a Storefront?

We currently have a Community Source! Source URL: https://community-apps.sidestore.io/sidecommunity.json

We also have a service called [SideStore Connect](https://connect.sidestore.io) which allows devs to publish their own apps.

### Why does my app have an update called "pacer test"?

This was a test update to see if there were problems between major versions, and shouldn‚Äôt be seen during normal use. If you see this issue, and it‚Äôs after release, then reinstall SideStore or report it as a bug.

### Why do my JIT based apps not automatically activate JIT?

We currently don‚Äôt have an automatic JIT activation method, and if we do you would need the SideStore VPN on.

### Does SideStore have an iPadOS UI?

We sure do!

### I saw an iMac or MacBook Pro get added to my account. Is it safe, and is it a real Mac?

These Macs are not real, and they are automatically generated by the Anisette server to assist with login. No private data is sent to the Anisette server either, as the data the server gives is used on SideStore only.

### Why is my account getting locked when I use SideStore?

Older Anisette servers that are used by many users are known to cause locking of Apple ID's. Please use one of the official Anisette servers, or host your own [anisette-v3-server](advanced/anisette).

### Why do I get error -36607?

This is a login issue with the Anisette server. There isn‚Äôt really much of any info about it other than changing Anisette servers sometimes helps, or you can keep trying to login until it does.

### Can I transfer my AltStore/Sideloady apps?

Yes, just don‚Äôt remove the original app on your device. Go into SideStore and sideload the same or updated IPA, and it should be added to your list of apps within SideStore with your data still intact.

### Why do I need to refresh SideStore first thing after login?

This is because AltServer or other programs sideload SideStore with their own app groupID, while we use our own. Refreshing SideStore changes it to ours, which makes apps disappear as their groupIDs are not updated. It‚Äôs best to not sideload anything before refreshing SideStore on a clean install.

### Can I do OTA updates?

Yep! Just click the update button!

### I want to test a SideStore version, and I want my data to stay when switching to a test version. Do I remove my app or sideload the test version via SideStore?

You can sideload via SideStore and your data should be the same. We don‚Äôt have an enrollment toggle to go to other versions. We also cannot guarantee your data transfers when testing an unofficial or nightly build.

### My apps disappeared and I don't know what to do

Don't panic! Re-sideload the apps without removing them from your device, and your data should be fine. Unfortunately it's possible that your deactivated apps are gone, but to confirm that just refresh SideStore to see if they come back.

### I'm unable to select my pairing file with any file type

Make sure your pairing file's extension ends with `.mobiledevicepairing` or `.plist`. If it doesn't, double check to see if you had zipped your pairing file before sending it to your phone. Failing to do so may lead to the file being corrupted during transport. Also, when signing Sidestore with a certificate, you won't be able to select the pairing file from within app. You can try moving the pairing file to the root directory of the SideStore folder in the Files app in "On My iPhone/iPad", and naming it `ALTPairingFile.mobiledevicepairing`. If you do not see the Sidestore folder in the files app, connect your phone to your computer, and you can drag and drop the pairing file to the files of the Sidestore app. Ensure to change it to name mentioned above. Note that it is case sensitive.

### Cannot start DebugServer

There is times when the Debugserver doesn't work. However, there is a fix you can try.

**Make a new pairing file**

To start the process of using a new pairing file you go to settings tab and click Reset Pairing file, and you accept the prompt. Then you just follow the [Pairing File instructions](installation/pairing-file).
