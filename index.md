# Welcome

Here you can find guides that aid in the installation and usage of [SideStore](https://sidestore.io), as well as references for developers working with it.

## Getting Started Guides

To start with SideStore, it's adviced to create a dedicated burner account.
If you have a burner account, you can continue with the Getting Started.
Advanced users can checkout the various Adv. guides.
If you have any questions/problems, check the FAQ before asking your question in the Discord server.

- [FAQ](references/faq)

## Advanced Guides

Again, you don't need to go through these if you only want to sideload. These guides are meant for more advanced/specific usecases.
