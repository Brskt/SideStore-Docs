title: Pairing File
description: Pairing files are essential to SideStore's functionality.

Using Jitterbugpair (*not* the Jitterbug app) allows us to create a pairing file for programs like SideStore to talk to your device. This is required to use SideStore, or it will not function.

Download Jitterbugpair for [Windows (64-bit)](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/download/v1.3.1/jitterbugpair-win64.zip), [macOS](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/download/v1.3.1/jitterbugpair-macos.zip), or [Linux](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/download/v1.3.1/jitterbugpair-linux.zip).

**Pairing Instructions**

1. Extract the Jitterbugpair zip file.
2. Plug your device into your computer, and open your device to its home screen. Once done, execute the program.
    * Your device may ask you to trust your computer. Make sure to accept this prompt, as it is required for the pairing process.
3. Once it is done, you will get a file that ends with `.mobiledevicepairing`.
4. Transfer this file to your device using iTunes, or any other method.
    * Transferring using cloud storage may change the file's extension (most likely turning into a .txt file), so be careful. It is also possible to change the extension to `.plist` for use with older SideStore versions, like `0.1.1`.
On Windows, you might have to execute the program using Command Prompt or Powershell, as it can sometimes not open by double clicking the `.exe` file.

5. In File Explorer, navigate to the folder where jitterbugpair is located.
6. In the navigation bar where the folder location is, click an empty spot and type `powershell`. It should open a (possibly blue colored) window called PowerShell.
7. From there, type `./jitterbugpair.exe` and press enter while your device is plugged in.
