# Make a Source

SideStore is fully compatible with AltStore Sources (or AltSources). The official AltSource [documentation](https://faq.altstore.io/developers/make-a-source) provides all the details you need to make your own AltSource. AltSources allow your audience to view, install, and update all your available apps easily using either AltStore and SideStore.

Some recommended third-party tools that assist in creating and using your AltSources:
- You can try using the community-built [AltStudio](https://altstudio.app/) (WIP) to generate you an AltSource using an IPA automatically!
- You can use the community-built [AltSource Browser](https://altsource.by.lao.sb/browse/) after editing your AltSource draft to see a visual display of your AltSource before finalizing your changes, allowing you to correct any errors before publishing them!

# Distributing your Source

You can create a link to automatically add your AltSource by using this template: 
```
sidestore://source?url=[source url]
```
For more info, see [URL Schema](/docs/advanced/url-schema). It is often helpful to create the link to your AltSource in this format, then put it into a link shortener such as ```tinyurl.com```. However, if a user tries to use a sidestore:// link without SideStore already installed, it will crash, so some documentation may be helpful.

## That's it!

Here are some good existing AltSources: The [official AltStore](https://apps.altstore.io) source, the [SideStore community](https://github.com/SideStore/Community-Source) source, the [StikJIT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StephenDev0/StikJIT/refs/heads/main/repo.json) source, and the [DolphiniOS](https://altstore.oatmealdome.me) source.
