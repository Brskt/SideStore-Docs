# Make a Source

The [official AltStore webpage](https://faq.altstore.io/developers/make-a-source) provides all the details you need about and to make your own AltSource. AltSources allow your audience to view, install, and update all your avaliable apps easily across both AltStore and SideStore.

SideStore-specific limitations include:

Instead of using the "altstore-classic" protocol, SideStore uses the "sidestore" protocol. This means you can create a link to automatically add your own source by using this template: ```sidestore://source?url=https://yoursourcehere.com/apps.json``` (for more info, see (URL Schema)[advanced/url-schema]). It is often helpful to create your link as such, then put it into a link shortener such as <tinyurl.com>.

To maintain compatibility with Feather, you can add the bundleIdentifier key to your AltSource (as well as inside "apps").

## That's all there is!

Here are some good existing AltSources: The [official AltStore](https://apps.altstore.io) source, the [SideStore community](https://github.com/SideStore/Community-Source) source, the [StikJIT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StephenDev0/StikJIT/refs/heads/main/repo.json) source, or the [DolphiniOS](https://altstore.oatmealdome.me) source.

It is highly recommended to use the [AltSource Browser](https://altsource.by.lao.sb/browse/) to get a visual display of your source outside of AltStore before publishing.
