Here are some good existing AltSources: The [primary AltStore Source](https://apps.altstore.io), the [SideStore community source](https://github.com/SideStore/Community-Source), any of the Sources at [Quark Sources](https://quarksources.github.io), or the [DolphiniOS Source](https://altstore.oatmealdome.me/).

Using this [AltSource Browser](https://altsource.by.lao.sb/browse/) to get a visual display of your Source outside of AltStore before publishing it is highly recommended.
