# Making a Source

[The official AltStore webpage](https://faq.altstore.io/developers/make-a-source) provides all the details you need to make your own AltSource. AltSources allow your audience to view, install, and update all your avaliable apps easily.

SideStore-specific limitations include:

Instead of using the "altstore-classic" protocol, SideStore uses the "sidestore" protocol. This means you can create a link to automatically add your own source by using this template: ```sidestore://source?url=https://yoursourceurlhere.com/apps.json```. It is often helpful to create your link as such, then put it into a link shortener such as tinyurl.com.

To maintain compatibility with Feather, you can add the bundleIdentifier key to your Source (as well as inside "apps").

## That's all there is!

Here are some good existing AltSources: The [primary AltStore Source](https://apps.altstore.io), the [SideStore community source](https://github.com/SideStore/Community-Source), any of the Sources at [Quark Sources](https://quarksources.github.io), or the [DolphiniOS Source](https://altstore.oatmealdome.me/).

Using this [AltSource Browser](https://altsource.by.lao.sb/browse/) to get a visual display of your Source outside of AltStore before publishing it is highly recommended.
