There are many methods to enabling JIT, such as AltServer, SideJITServer, and more. This tutorial will cover the use of StikJIT, as it is the method we currently recommend.
:::

## Prerequisites
* An iDevice on iOS/iPadOS 17.4 or above, excluding 18.4b1
* At least 1 free app slot

## StikJIT installation with SideStore or AltStore Classic

1. **Install SideStore or AltStore Classic:**  
   Visit the [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/#get-started) or [AltStore Classic](https://altstore.io) website and follow the provided installation instructions.

2. **Install StosVPN:**  
   It is recommended to install [StosVPN](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stosvpn/id6744003051).
   
4. **Obtain StikJIT:**  
   Add the source for [SideStore](https://tinyurl.com/SideStoreStikJIT) or [AltStore](https://tinyurl.com/AltstoreStikJIT).

5. **Install via SideStore or AltStore Classic:**  
   Use SideStore or AltStore to install StikJIT.

6. **Installation procedures:**
   Follow the standard installation procedures in the usage guide below.

## StikDebug installation with App Store

1. **Install StikDebug**
   Install StikDebug from the App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stikdebug/id6744045754). Something nice- the VPN present in StikDebug is similar to the one used in SideStore, meaning you can install and refresh apps using it.

2. **Installation procedures:**
   Follow the standard installation procedures in the usage guide below.

### Standard installation procedures:

1. **Enable VPN:**  
   Start by activating StosVPN for StikJIT or the built-in VPN in StikDebug.

2. **Upload the Pairing File:**  
   When prompted, import the same **unzipped pairing file** obtained via JitterbugPair you use for SideStore. For more information on obtaining this pairing file, see [here](installation/pairing-file).

### Every time:

1. **Enable VPN:**  
   Start by activating StosVPN for StikJIT or the built-in VPN in StikDebug.
   
2. **Activate JIT:**  
   Click the “Enable JIT” button and select an app from the list to activate the JIT functionality.

## Offline JIT Enabling
To enable JIT offline, make sure both Wi-Fi and Mobile Data are OFF when you launch StikJIT (Airplane Mode). You can then enable JIT as normal.
