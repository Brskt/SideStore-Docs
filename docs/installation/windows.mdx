Please make sure that on your machine the non-Microsoft Store versions of [iCloud](https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2020/windows/001-39935-20200911-1A70AA56-F448-11EA-8CC0-99D41950005E/iCloudSetup.exe) and  [iTunes](https://apple.com/itunes.download/win6) (iTunes should already be installed from the pairing guide section) are installed. Before you start, make sure to have all steps completed found in the [prerequisites](prerequisites)!

The non-Microsoft Store version of iCloud was removed from Apple’s website in mid-September 2022. The above link directs to an older version of iCloud that is still compatible with AltServer, and still available directly from Apple’s servers.

1. Download `altinstaller.zip` from [AltStore's website](https://cdn.altstore.io/file/altstore/altinstaller.zip). Extract `altinstaller.zip` and run `setup.exe`. In your Windows taskbar, type in "AltServer" and click "Run as administrator." Make sure to allow access to private networks if prompted. AltStore will appear as an icon in the tray.
2. Download the SideStore IPA which you can find [here](https://github.com/sidestore/sidestore/releases/latest/download/sidestore.ipa).
3. Hold shift and click on the AltServer tray icon. Click "Sideload .ipa", and select `sidestore.ipa`.
4. Approve the "Developer App" with your Apple ID's email.
    * You can find this in Settings, under "General", and then "VPN & Device Management".
5. Open SideStore and press allow on prompts until you reach a screen asking for your pairing file, then stop.

After you finish, proceed to generate your [pairing-file](pairing-file).
