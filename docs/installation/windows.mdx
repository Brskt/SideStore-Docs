Please make sure that on your machine the non-Microsoft Store versions of [iCloud](https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2020/windows/001-39935-20200911-1A70AA56-F448-11EA-8CC0-99D41950005E/iCloudSetup.exe) and iTunes [64-bit](https://apple.com/itunes.download/win64) or [32-bit](https://apple.com/itunes.download/win32) are installed. Before you start, make sure to have all steps completed found in the [Prerequisites](prerequisites), and that you have a [Pairing File](pairing-file)!

The non-Microsoft Store version of iCloud was removed from Apple’s website sometime in mid-September, 2022. The above link directs to an older version of iCloud that is still compatible, and still available directly from Apple’s servers.

1. Download altinstaller.zip from [AltStore's website](https://cdn.altstore.io/file/altstore/altinstaller.zip). Extract altinstaller.zip and run Setup.exe. In your Windows taskbar, type in "AltServer" and click "Run as administrator." Make sure to allow access to private networks if prompted. AltStore will appear as an icon in the tray.
2. Download the SideStore IPA which you can find [here](https://github.com/sidestore/sidestore/releases/latest/download/sidestore.ipa).
3. Hold shift and click on the AltServer tray icon. Click "Sideload .ipa", and select the SideStore IPA file.
4. Approve the "Developer App" with your Apple ID's email.
    * You can find this in Settings, under "General", and then "VPN & Device Management".
5. Open SideStore, select your pairing file, and sign in with your Apple ID.

When you finish, then follow the [post-install instructions](post-install).
