Before you start, make sure to have all steps completed found in the [prerequisites](prerequisites)!

1. The following commands will install usbmuxd and docker. Run these as a non-root user on your machine and you will only have to do this once.
```bash
sudo apt install -y usbmuxd
curl -fsSL https://test.docker.com -o test-docker.sh
sudo sh test-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
2. Restart your shell to ensure changes are made. Now, plug in your iDevice. If you recieve a prompt, select "trust" and enter your passcode. Now, run Altcon with Docker using this code (must be run every time to install SideStore):
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}/:/mnt/ -v /var/run/usbmuxd:/var/run/usbmuxd ghcr.io/sidestore/altcon
```
3. Altcon will pair with your device. When you recieve another prompt, select "trust" and enter your passcode again.
4. On your secondary device, do the following:
    * Approve the "Developer App" under your Apple ID's email (you can find this in Settings, under "General", and then "VPN & Device Management").
    * Open the Settings app.
    * Navigate to the 'Privacy and Security' section.
    * Turn on 'Developer Mode' at the bottom.
5. Open SideStore and select "allow" for prompts until SideStore requests a pairing file. Exit the app now.

Now, proceed to generate your [pairing file](pairing-file).
