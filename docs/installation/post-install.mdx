The last step to installing SideStore is to refresh SideStore within itself.

To do this, you need to:

1. Connect to StosVPN.
2. Open SideStore.
3. If you haven't already, select the pairing file.
4. Navigate to "My Apps".
5. Select the "x DAYS" button, (x is the number of days until expiry). A prompt asking about your signing certificate should appear, tap "Refresh Now". If a prompt appears asking you if you want to revoke a certificate from AltStore, tap "yes".
    * If successful, this will open a blank Safari tab or open to your home screen, accompanied by a notification notating this.

If SideStore is not refreshed, a bug causing early expiry will require you to reinstall SideStore. There is a plan to have this done automatically, but for now it needs to be done manually.
If you reinstall SideStore or install it on another device under the same Apple ID using AltServer, your certificate will be revoked and you will need to refresh it manually like again (on both devices, if applicable).
