Before you start, make sure to have all steps completed found in the [Prerequisites](prerequisites), and that you have a [pairing file](pairing-file)!

1. Download AltServer from [AltStore's website](https://cdn.altstore.io/file/altstore/altserver.zip). Copy AltServer.app to your `Applications` folder, then open it (using Finder, Launchpad, or Spotlight). It should appear as an icon in your menu bar.
2. Download the SideStore IPA which you can find [here](https://github.com/sidestore/sidestore/releases/latest/download/sidestore.ipa).
3. Hold option and click on the AltServer menu bar icon. Click "Sideload .ipa", and select the SideStore IPA file.
4. Approve the "Developer App" with your Apple ID's email on your secondary device.
    * You can find this in Settings, under "General", and then "VPN & Device Management".
5. Open SideStore, select your pairing file, and sign in with your Apple ID.

When you finish, follow the [post-install instructions](post-install).
