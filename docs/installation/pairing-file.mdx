JitterbugPair (*not* the Jitterbug app) allows us to create a pairing file for programs like SideStore to talk to your device. This is required to use SideStore, or it will not function.

Download JitterbugPair for [Windows (64-bit)](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/download/v1.3.1/jitterbugpair-win64.zip), [macOS](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore-Docs/releases/download/need-a-place-to-put-jittterbug/jitterbugpair), or [Linux](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/download/v1.3.1/jitterbugpair-linux.zip).

## Pairing Instructions

:::tip

Depending on your method, when transferring your .mobiledevicepariring file, the file extension might change (usually to .txt or cropping off the "ing"). It is always recommended to zip your pairing file before transferring it. SideStore only accepts .mobiledevicepairing files (or .plist files in older versions).
:::

### Windows

1. **Extract** `jitterbugpair-win64.zip`.
2. **Set a passcode** for your device if you haven't already. Unlock your device and connect it to your computer via cable. If a prompt appears, tap "trust" and type in your passcode.
3. Open your device to the homescreen.
4. In File Explorer, locate `jitterbugpair.exe` and run it by double-clicking or right-clicking and selecting "open". The first time you run the tool, you will get a prompt for your passcode on your secondary device. Type it in, then keep the screen on and unlocked and run the tool again.
5. JitterbugPair will generate a **pairing file** in the same folder. This file will have the extension `.mobiledevicepairing`.
6. For best results, compress the file into a .zip folder. Then, **transfer the pairing file** to your iOS device using One/iCloud/Google Drive, email, or another method you prefer.

On Windows, you might have to execute the program using Command Prompt or Powershell, as it can sometimes not open by double clicking the `.exe` file.

7. In File Explorer, navigate to the folder where jitterbugpair is located.
8. In the navigation bar where the folder location is, click an empty spot and type `powershell`. It should open a (possibly blue colored) window called PowerShell.
9. From there, type `./jitterbugpair.exe` and press enter while your device is plugged in.

### macOS

1. **Extract** `jitterbugpair-macos.zip` (if applicable).
2. **Set a passcode** for your device if you haven't already. Unlock your device and connect it to your computer via cable. If a prompt appears, tap "trust" and type in your passcode.
3. Open your device to the homescreen.
4. Find and open the extracted `jitterbugpair` file (it should have a black and green icon) by double-clicking it or right-clicking it and selecting "open". The first time you run the tool, you will get a prompt for your passcode on your secondary device. Type it in, then keep the screen on and unlocked and run the tool again.
5. If you get the message" "macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware":
   - Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security
   - Scroll down to the message about the app
   - Click "Open Anyway," if the program doesn't run automatically, try manually running it again
6. JitterbugPair will generate a **pairing file** with the extension `.mobiledevicepairing` to your user's home folder.
7. If you can't find the pairing file:
   - Copy the name of the pairing file generated
   - Paste it into Finder
   - If you ran the program more than once, all pairing files for your device should appear since they share the same name
8. For best results, compress the file into a .zip folder. Then, **transfer the pairing file** to your iOS device via AirDrop, iCloud/One/Google Drive, email, or another method you prefer. 

### Linux

These instructions expect that you are familiar with the linux commandline.

1. **Extract** `jitterbugpair-linux.zip`.
2. Open a terminal in the extracted directory.
3. Make the program executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ./jitterbugpair
   ```
4. **Set a passcode** for your device if you haven't already. Unlock your device and connect it to your computer via cable. If a prompt appears, tap "trust" and type in your passcode.
5. Open your device to the homescreen.
6. Execute the program:
   ```bash
   ./jitterbugpair
   ```
7. The first time you execute the tool, you will get a prompt for your passcode on your secondary device. Type it in, then keep the screen on and unlocked and run the tool again. Type it in, then keep the screen on and unlocked and execute the tool again.
8. JitterbugPair will generate a **pairing file** with the extension `.mobiledevicepairing`.
