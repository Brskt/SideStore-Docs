### **I followed the instructions, why is AltStore still not installing for me?**
This could happen for a number of reasons, but these solutions have reportedly helped:

- Have you said ‚ÄúTrust‚Äù on both your computer and phone after connecting it to your computer? You can check by opening iTunes and seeing if a dialog box pops up asking if you want to trust your phone.
- Try using another Apple ID. If necessary, you can create a new Apple ID specifically for use with AltStore for free.
- **(Windows only)** Make sure iTunes and/or iCloud are running while using AltServer.
- **(Windows only)** Right-click AltServer and choose ‚ÄúRun as Administrator‚Äù.
- **(Windows only)** Did you install iTunes or iCloud from the Microsoft Store? If so, you‚Äôll need to uninstall them and download the latest versions directly from Apple.

### **AltStore freezes/takes forever to sign-in.**
This could happen for a number of reasons. If you‚Äôre experiencing this issue, please check the following:

- **(Windows only)** Your Windows firewall might be blocking incoming network connections to AltServer. You must enable network access for AltServer in your firewall settings for it to receive refreshed apps from AltStore.
- **(Windows only)** Did you install iTunes or iCloud from the Microsoft Store? If so, you‚Äôll need to uninstall them and download the latest versions directly from Apple.
- **(Windows only)** You may need to make sure iTunes and iCloud are running on your computer as well.
- Are you on public/work/school WiFi? If so, your WiFi might be preventing devices from discovering each other. Try connecting to your phone‚Äôs hotspot and trying again.
- Have you said ‚ÄúTrust‚Äù on both your computer and phone after connecting it to your computer? You can check by opening iTunes and seeing if a dialog box pops up asking if you want to trust your phone.
- Finally, try plugging your phone into your computer. This will fix almost all connectivity problems, but will mean AltStore most likely won't be able to refresh apps for you in the background over WiFi.

### **AltStore says ‚ÄúCould not find AltServer‚Äù when trying to refresh.**
This means AltStore could not discover a running AltServer on the same WiFi network. If you‚Äôre getting this error, try the following:

- Make sure AltServer is running and connected to the same WiFi network as AltStore.
- **(Windows only)** Your Windows firewall might be blocking incoming network connections to AltServer. You must enable network access for AltServer in your firewall settings for it to receive refreshed apps from AltStore.
- **(Windows only)** Did you install iTunes or iCloud from the Microsoft Store? If so, you‚Äôll need to uninstall them and download the latest versions directly from Apple.
- **(Windows only)** You may need to make sure iTunes and iCloud are running on your computer as well.
- Are you on public/work/school WiFi? If so, your WiFi might be preventing devices from discovering each other. Try connecting to your phone‚Äôs hotspot and trying again.
- Have you said ‚ÄúTrust‚Äù on both your computer and phone after connecting it to your computer? You can check by opening iTunes and seeing if a dialog box pops up asking if you want to trust your phone.
- Finally, try plugging your phone into your computer. This will fix almost all connectivity problems, but will mean AltStore most likely won't be able to refresh apps for you in the background over WiFi.

### **I‚Äôm unable to change my network settings to allow devices to communicate with each other (such as on school/work/public WiFi).**
You can always install and refresh apps without WiFi by plugging your phone in to your computer. However, this means AltStore won't be able to refresh apps for you in the background over WiFi.

### **What is the recommended way to use AltStore?**
- Set AltServer to launch automatically when turning on/logging in to your computer.
- Leave your computer in sleep mode when not using it, and plugged in if possible (especially at night, since iOS will wake up apps in the background much more frequently when the phone is plugged in and not doing anything).
- Open AltStore once a day/every few days so iOS learns to prioritize it and let it refresh apps in the background as much as possible.
- Don‚Äôt stress; AltStore is designed to check several times over the course of the week. Leave your laptop in your bag, leave your desktop off, whatever; just make sure it's active every once in a while so AltStore can refresh üôÇ

### **What apps are available in AltStore?**
Right now, Delta and Clip are the only apps listed in AltStore. However, you can sideload additional apps from the Files app, and support for 3rd party sources is coming soon!

### **How do I sideload additional apps (.ipa files) with AltStore?**
From the My Apps tab, tap the "+" button in the top left, then select the .ipa file you want to sideload.

### **Do I need to worry about ‚Äúrevokes‚Äù?**
No. Other alternative app stores use ‚Äúenterprise certificates‚Äù to allow people to install apps. However, this is explicitly disallowed by Apple, resulting in them actively shutting down, or ‚Äúrevoking‚Äù, these enterprise certificates used by other app stores. This causes apps to stop opening every once in a while until a new enterprise certificate can be obtained.

Because AltStore doesn‚Äôt use enterprise certificates, there is no fear of Apple shutting down AltStore by revoking a single certificate (since each person technically now has their own signing certificate).

### **Why do you need my Apple ID?**
Apple allows anyone with an Apple ID to install apps they‚Äôve built themselves onto their devices for testing. AltStore uses your Apple ID to communicate with Apple's servers on your behalf and perform the necessary steps to prepare your account for installing apps onto your device.

### **Do you save or send my Apple ID to anyone besides Apple?**
Your Apple ID is never sent to anyone but Apple. AltStore does save your Apple ID so it can refresh apps for you automatically, but it is stored securely in the device‚Äôs keychain. AltServer does not save your Apple ID, and requires you to enter your credentials each time.

### **Why does it say my apps will expire in 7 days?**
Unfortunately, apps that have been installed using non-developer Apple IDs (in other words, Apple IDs not tied to a $99/year Apple developer account) are only valid for 7 days, at which point they will no longer open. To compensate for this, AltStore will periodically attempt to refresh your apps in the background, and you can always manually refresh your apps from within AltStore.

### **How long before apps installed with a developer Apple ID expire?**
Apps installed with a developer Apple ID expire after a year.

### **Does AltServer need to be running to install/refresh apps?**
Yes, AltServer must be running and on the same WiFi network as AltStore when installing or refreshing apps.

### **Does this mean I need to keep AltServer running 24/7?**
No. AltStore periodically checks in the background to see if it‚Äôs on the same WiFi network as AltServer, and if so refreshes your apps. This means as long as this check succeeds at least once during the 7 day period, your apps will never expire.

For best results, we recommend setting AltServer to automatically run in the background when turning on your computer, and then just leave your computer in sleep mode every once in a while (Windows users might need to allow network connectivity when the computer is sleeping).

### **Will letting AltServer run in the background drain my battery or affect my computer‚Äôs performance?**
No. When running in the background, AltServer does nothing but wait for incoming connections from AltStore.

### **How can I increase the frequency AltStore refreshes apps in the background?**
iOS determines how frequently to wake AltStore in the background based on how often you open the app. For this reason, we strongly recommend opening AltStore at least once every few days. Otherwise, iOS might decide you no longer are using the app and stop waking it in the background.

### **How can I see if AltStore is refreshing apps for me in the background?**
On the Settings tab, swipe up with 3 fingers 3 times to make a "Debug" section appear. You can then press "View Refresh Attempts" to see a log of all the times AltStore attempted to refresh in the background.

### **How do I download beta versions of Delta and AltStore?**
1. Open the Settings tab in AltStore.
2. Press ‚ÄúLink Patreon account‚Äù.
3. Sign in with your Patreon account. After signing in, the message on the Patreon screen will now begin with ‚ÄúHey [your name]‚Äù. If a different Patreon account than the one you want to use is already logged in via Safari, you may need to sign out in Safari first.
4. Open the Browse tab. Now, the beta versions of AltStore and Delta will be listed alongside their non-beta versions, designated with a ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù badge.
5. Download the beta of your choice.

**IMPORTANT:** If you download the AltStore beta, make sure to delete the regular AltStore afterwards. Having two AltStores installed might cause conflicts with each other. Having both Delta and Delta beta installed will not cause any issues, however.

### **How do I add 3rd party sources to AltStore?**
You need to download the AltStore beta to add 3rd party sources. See ‚ÄúHow do I download beta versions of Delta and AltStore?‚Äù for how to download the AltStore beta, then you can add sources from the Browse tab.

### **How do I access the AltStore Discord? ($5+ tiers only)**
Follow this very helpful guide from Patreon.

### **Where does my name show up in AltStore? ($10 tier only)**
Your name will appear on the Patreon screen in the AltStore settings (same screen where you connect your Patreon account) under the ‚ÄúSpecial thanks to...‚Äù section. And seriously, thank you so much üòäüôè

### **What happens when if I stop being a patron?**
You‚Äôll still have normal access to everything until the end of the month. At that point, you‚Äôll lose access to beta apps, the AltStore Discord ($5+ patrons), and your name will no longer be listed in AltStore ($10 patrons).

### **What exactly does it mean when I lose access to beta apps?**
AltStore will no longer list the beta apps in the Browse tab and will also remove them from the My Apps app. This means they can no longer be refreshed by AltStore, and will no longer open once they expire. However, as long as you don‚Äôt delete the apps, you can still refresh them in the future and keep all your data if you choose to become a patron again.
